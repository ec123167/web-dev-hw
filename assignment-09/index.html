  <p id="one"> The psychedelic movement had an effect, not just on music, but also on many
     aspects of popular culture. This included style of dress, language and the
     way people spoke, art, literature and philosophy.</p>
  <p id="two">The name “psychedelic” refers to drugs that were popular with the youth
    culture of the time. Posters for rock concerts tried to visually express the
    feeling of tripping out.</p>
  <p id="three">The visual motifs of psychedelic art include Art Nouveau-inspired
     curvilinear shapes, illegible hand-drawn type, and intense optical color
     vibration inspired by the pop art movement.</p>
