1. The universal selector applies to every element on the page, while element
selectors use element names to apply to x element.  Class selectors are prepended
with a dot and id selectors are prepended with a hashtag; they can be combined
with an element selector to be more specific.  The selector you choose depends on
how narrow of a focus the styling needs to be.

2. I chose lavender, thistle, darkorchid, and palevioletred for the non-image
colors.  Purple is the staple psychedelic color and the tints contrast with the
tone and the palevioletred.


3. I'm having a hard time understanding exactly how to structure elements
through css.  I would assign an id or class to a division and then add css
properties and they would have no effect.  When I assigned ids to the paragraph
and image elements I received results.
