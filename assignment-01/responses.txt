1. How is the web different than the internet?


2. Briefly describe how the internet works. ("Magic.")


3. What is a directory, and what is its relationship to files?


4. Why is using a VCS beneficial?

Using a Version Control System is beneficial as it allows you to have a snapshot of the totality of your project anytime.  It
is a type of database that acts as a recorder of history to track any changes that are made to files.  A VCS is powerful
collaborative tool that allows you to see what all changes your partners have made and are making and for why they made
changes.  Most essentially it allows reversion to previous states and acts as a backup in case a group member has their files
deleted from their computer.



5. State at least one thing you found interesting this topic, or that you didn't know before.

Andrew Blum’s Ted Talk is always interesting to watch as the physicality of the internet is never discussed.  It’s hard to
wrap your mind around it even when you learn that the internet is in thousands of miles of wire beneath the oceans.  How do
the engineers figure out how to permanently tether cable to the ocean floor?  It seems an impossibility to traverse an entire
ocean with cable but it is not.  I can’t image how difficult (or not) it is to repair broken cable in the middle of the
Atlantic or how the cable survives all the wear and tear of the ocean.
