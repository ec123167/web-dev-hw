Andrew Blum’s Ted Talk is always interesting to watch as the physicality of the internet is never discussed.  It’s hard to
wrap your mind around it even when you learn that the internet is in thousands of miles of wire beneath the oceans.  How do
the engineers figure out how to permanently tether cable to the ocean floor?  It seems an impossibility to traverse an entire
ocean with cable but it is not.  I can’t image how difficult (or not) it is to repair broken cable in the middle of the
Atlantic or how the cable survives all the wear and tear of the ocean.
