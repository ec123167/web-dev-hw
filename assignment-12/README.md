1. My company's name is Cam's Camera Rentals and we offer cameras and camera
equipment to rent.  Our brand colors are black and silver and two words to
describe the theme of the website are steady and smooth.

2. In display inline, new lines are not forced so content remains on the same
line.  Display inline-block is like display inline except the margin property is
respected and the width needs to be set because the content will fill the
container.  Display block displays inline elements like linear blocks.

3. I now see why I'm having trouble with css as I'm not applying divs and classes
as specifically as they need to be.  I'll need to figure this out before I can
build a site aesthetically well.
