<p>A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet
  mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and feel the
  charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the bliss of souls like
  mine. I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere
  tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents. I should be incapable of drawing
  a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that I never was a greater
  artist than now. When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and
  the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees,
  and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw myself down
  among the tall grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close to the earth,
  a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the little
  world among the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless indescribable forms
  of the insects and flies, then I feel the presence of the Almighty, who formed
  us in his own image, and the breath.
