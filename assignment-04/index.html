  <h1>Continent's End</h1>
  <h2>Robinson Jeffers</h2>
  <hr />
  <p>
    At the equinox when the earth was veiled in a late rain, wreathed <br />
    with wet poppies, waiting spring, <br>
    The ocean swelled for a far storm and beat its boundary, the <br>
    ground-swell shook the beds of granite.</p>
<p>
    I gazing at the boundaries of granite and spray, the established <br>
    sea-marks, felt behind me <br>
    Mountain and plain, the immense breadth of the continent, before <br>
    me the mass and doubled stretch of water.</p>
<p>
    I said: You yoke the Aleutian seal-rocks with the lava and coral <br>
    sowings that flower the south, <br>
    Over your flood the life that sought the sunrise faces ours that has <br>
    followed the evening star.</p>
<p>
    The long migrations meet across you and it is nothing to you, you <br>
    have forgotten us, mother. <br>
    You were much younger when we crawled out of the womb and <br>
    lay in the sun's eye on the tideline.</p>
<p>
    It was long and long ago; we have grown proud since then and <br>
    you have grown bitter; life retains <br>
    Your mobile soft unquiet strength; and envies hardness, the <br>
    insolent quietness of stone.</p>
<p>
    The tides are in our veins, we still mirror the stars, life is your <br>
    child, but there is in me <br>
    Older and harder than life and more impartial, the eye that <br>
    watched before there was an ocean.</p>
<p>
    That watched you fill your beds out of the condensation of thin <br>
    vapor and watched you change them, <br>
    That saw you soft and violent wear your boundaries down, eat <br>
    rock, shift places with the continents.</p>
<p>
    Mother, though my song's measure is like your surf-beat's ancient <br>
    rhythm I never learned it of you. <br>
    Before there was any water there were tides of fire, both our <br>
    tones flow from the older fountain.</p>
