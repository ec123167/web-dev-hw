1. Atom is a nice text editor because you can push work right to github.  I'm not
sure if other text editors do this or not.


2. Thinking about websites today, opacity plays a big role in making sites more
dynamic.  It eases the hardness of the colors and makes the website viewable
for longer periods of time.


3. I can't figure out how to get the dropdown from glitching the background
without making the background position absolute/fixed.  It's also weird how
depending on the size of the browser window and the number of elements the
background will revert to color; also does this when the drop displays.  Additionally
I can't get the nav to sticky.  I believe these problems are the result of poor
positioning and to fix them I need to develop a better understanding of positioning relationships.
