1. I chose a serif for the headings and a sans-serif for the body.  'ZCOOL'
attracted my eye and I browsed google font pairings for a complimentary sans-serif.

2. System fonts are fonts pre-installed on an operating system.  Web fonts are
custom fonts that are uploaded and hosted on a server.  Web-safe fonts are
reliable fonts to use on the web as these fonts are pre-installed across varying
operating systems.  It's important to have fallback fonts in case the user's
system will not or is unable load the set font.  Multiple fallback fonts are
compiled into a font stack.

3.  I determined the piece I wanted to use and the fonts, and then proceeded
on to the structural and semantic html.  Next I added color.
