# Assignment 5
## Earl Clark

1. There are of seven head elements and many more body elements in HTML5. Head
elements come first in the document as the head is the container for high level
information to be processed and metadata to be stored.  These elements do such
things as delineate the character set, page dimensions, and style, as well as
link information the document needs in order to load.  Body elements come after
the head and contain the information that is to be displayed to the user. These
elements communicate the knowledge to the user.  

2. Structural markups embed information in the document to guide the user
visually and so a DOM can be made and the browser can understand.  Semantic
markups reinforce the meaning of the structural information through emphasis
and explanation.

3. I set up the document with the head and body elements and then looked in a
food cabinet for a recipe on a food product.  I visited the company's site
and chose a recipe for the assignment.  I downloaded an image of the recipe and
resized it to a smaller dimension.  Then I went ahead and completed the rest of
the instructions.
