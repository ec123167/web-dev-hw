# Assignment 6
## Earl clark

1. The most typical form I come across while browsing the web is the search bar.
I cannot think of a site without one.  Obviously they're for searching the site
or the web.  Another typical form is the username and password form for signing
into such things as email or moodle.  This past week I filled out a registration
form which was mostly text inputs but also included a date input with a dropdown
menu.  The form determined my eligibility for club baseball.

2. A text input can be a search bar.  Search bars are the main component of
search engines such as bing or google.  A selection input can be used to select
one or more answers.  Selection inputs like checkboxes are common in online
quizzes.  Button inputs such as an upload button allow a user to submit a file
or a form.  Moodle uses upload buttons for assignments.

3. There was a lot of attribute information to take in on this assignment but I
understand that some are more suited to css.  I didn't realize until Friday that
an assignment had been posted given that the main site was not used for this
week.  With their many attributes, forms are complicated compared to what we
have learned so far.
