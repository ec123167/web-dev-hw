1. Divisions and spans identify any element with a unique description using the
global id attribute (id=""), while the class attribute demarcates similar types
of elements under a same assignment(s).  Whereas divisions increase the
structural integrity of code by acting as the block containers, the span element
functions to further the structural clarity by working inside divisions to
identify text needing to appear visually unique.

2. Alt text provides a detailed description of the image for the visually
impaired, and also acts as backup in case the image does not load.

3. Growing up I remember the pain of flash and keeping it up to date as well
as playing flash games.  I'm glad html5 has integrated video and audio.  I
imagine that keeping websites working with older html and older browsers is a
pain, and I wonder at some point if developers just abandon support for the
outdated systems. Splitting url's at certain points seem to break them so I'll
keep this in mind.
