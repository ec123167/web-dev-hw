# Assignment 8
## Earl clark

1. It's apparent that learning a web language is similar to learning a new
language.  It takes ongoing practice to be able to remember all there is to
remember, and I realize this is why there are content management systems which
simplify the amount of knowledge needed to do web design.  I'm unsure as to
whether web design is something I'd like to do to make money, but to have the
ability to design a website is certainly powerful.

2. I'm interested in learning the proper way to style.

3. This assignment was simple and I don't feel like I learned as much as I did
in past assignments. I believe my navigation elements are slightly off-center
for some reason. There must be a specific process and environment for taking
instruction pictures and for taking pictures of clothing products and the like.
